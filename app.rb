# C6: Should raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two
#  Currency objects with different currency codes.
   #False - I need to fix how the currency class handles spliting the amount
   # from the code and introduce and if/else so it detects a problem

# C7: Should be able to be multiplied by a Fixnum or Float and return a Currency object

currency_object_2 * 25    # => 125

# C8: Currency.new should be able to take one argument with a currency symbol embedded
#  in it, like "$1.20" or "â‚¬ 7.00", and figure out the correct currency code.
#  It can also take two arguments like before, one being the amount and the other
#  being the currency code.
   #False, I'll need to allow the currency class to parse the string
#Currency.new(1.20, :USD)  # => #<Currency:0x007ffe340b3a30 @amount=1.2, @code=:USD>

# CurrencyConverter objects:

# CC0: Should be initialized with a Hash of currency codes to conversion rates (see link to rates below)
# CC1: At first, just make this work with two currency codes and conversation rates,
#  with one rate being 1.0 and the other being the conversation rate. An example
#  would be this: {USD: 1.0, EUR: 0.74}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros.

# CC2: Should be able to take a Currency object and a requested currency code that is

#  120 yen, but also that a euro is worth 120/0.74 = 162.2 yen.
